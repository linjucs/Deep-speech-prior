# Tensorflow  Deep Speech Prior

An implementation of speech reconstruction methods from [Deep Image Prior (Ulyanov et al., 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10925) in PyTorch. 

The point of the project is to verify speech enhancement task using neural networks untrained on data prior to use.


## Requirements

Python3 with Python3 Tensorflow, and NumPy. CUDA and cuDNN are optional (settable within the script in a self-explanatory way) but strongly recommended.

## To use
TODO soon
```bash
mkdir output
```

Generate output speech with:
```bash
python3 deep_speech_prior.py
```
